# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat deploy --network bsctestnet --tags tokenv2
npx hardhat deploy --network bsctestnet --tags staking-score
npx hardhat deploy --network bsctestnet --tags airdrop-snapshot
```
